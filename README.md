# Home Assignment for Nanocorp Interview

## Introduction

Hello! My name is sosring, and I am excited to have the opportunity to complete this home assignment as part of my interview process for Nanocorp. 
In this markdown file, I will be discussing the project file structure. 

## Tech stack
- Nuxt 3
- Vuetify

## Project File Structure

- I'll only be explaining the component file structure as other directories 
are same as describe in the official documentation of 
[Nuxt](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/directory-structure/components)

- **components**: This directory contains reusable Vue.js components that can be used throughout your application.

> Here's an example code for a project directory structure:
```
├── components
│   └── base
│       └── header 
│       └── footer
|   └── section
|       └── index.vue  
|       └── matches 
│       └── stadium
│       └── FAQs
```

## Conclusion
By following this file structure, you can ensure that my code is easy to read.

Thank you for taking the time to review my work. I look forward to discussing this topic further during our upcoming interview.

Best regards,

Sosringdao Langthasa
